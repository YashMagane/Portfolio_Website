              Lately, I've been diving deep into some fascinating areas of AI
              and computing, and I wanted to share what I’ve been learning! From
              neural networks to GPU computing, it's been an exciting journey,
              and I feel like I’m only scratching the surface.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              One of the key topics I explored was DeepSeek, an AI research
              project focused on deep learning. Neural networks have always
              intrigued me, but learning more about reinforcement learning,
              matrix multiplication, and vectors has given me a clearer picture
              of how they actually function. Understanding these mathematical
              foundations has helped me appreciate how models learn and optimize
              their performance over time.

            </p>
            <p>
              Reinforcement learning (RL) is another concept that caught my
              attention. Unlike traditional supervised learning, where models
              learn from labeled data, RL involves training an agent to make
              decisions by interacting with an environment. The AI receives
              rewards or penalties based on its actions, gradually improving its
              decision-making abilities. This is the kind of technique used in
              game-playing AIs and robotics.

            </p>
            <p>
              Another huge revelation for me was the importance of GPU computing
              in AI. Unlike traditional CPUs, GPUs handle computations in
              parallel, making them ideal for deep learning tasks. I also
              learned about CUDA, a parallel computing platform by NVIDIA that
              allows developers to write programs that run efficiently on GPUs.
              Writing in CUDA opens up new possibilities for optimizing AI
              workloads and accelerating complex computations.

              A big thanks to the YouTube channel Computerphile for making these
              advanced topics easier to understand! Their videos break down
              complex concepts in a way that’s accessible and engaging. If
              you’re curious about AI, computing, or just tech in general, I
              highly recommend checking them out.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              I’m excited to continue this learning journey and explore more
              about deep learning, AI optimization, and parallel computing. If

          <h2>Dual Booting Linux</h2>

            Facing My Linux Knowledge Gap: A Journey from Interview to Dual
            Booting...

            <p>
              Recently, I had an interview for an Observability Engineer role,
              and while I was excited about the opportunity, I quickly realized
              I had a massive gap in my knowledge—Linux. During the interview, I
              was asked about system monitoring, log aggregation, and
              troubleshooting, and it became painfully clear that my
              understanding of Linux was nowhere near where it needed to be. I
              had dabbled in Linux before, but I never truly understood its
              importance until that moment.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              This realization made me take a step back. I had to go back to the
              basics, not just of Linux, but of operating systems in general.
              What makes an OS different from another? How does Linux compare to
              Windows, which I was so comfortable with? Unlike Windows, where
              everything is abstracted and simplified for the user, Linux
              exposes the raw mechanics of how an operating system interacts
              with hardware and software. Concepts like the filesystem
              hierarchy, user permissions, package management, and the
              terminal-driven nature of Linux started to make more sense to me.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>Dual Booting Linux</strong></p>
            <p>
              As I researched more, I stumbled upon something interesting—dual
              booting. Instead of running Linux on a virtual machine, I learned
              that I could install it alongside Windows and switch between them
              at boot. This sounded like a perfect way to fully immerse myself
              in Linux without giving up my existing setup. But there was a
              catch: dual booting isn’t exactly beginner-friendly. The process
              involves manual partitioning, which, if done incorrectly, could
              wipe out all my data. That was terrifying. One wrong move, and
              everything—my projects, software, and personal files—could
              disappear in an instant.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              This brought me to one of the most important lessons of this
              journey: back up everything before making major system changes. I
              made sure to back up all my critical files before proceeding. I
              then carefully followed the steps to create partitions, install
              Linux, and set up a bootloader. The experience was nerve-wracking,
              but once I successfully booted into Linux for the first time, I
              felt an incredible sense of accomplishment.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>Using Linux</strong></p>
            <p>
              Now that I have a proper Linux setup, my goal is to use it as my
              learning environment to explore the fundamentals of servers, cloud
              computing, cybersecurity, and system administration. These are
              crucial skills for any engineer working in observability and
              infrastructure. By working with Linux daily, I can familiarize
              myself with terminal commands, scripting, system processes, and
              security configurations—all of which will be invaluable in my
              career.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              This entire experience has been a humbling reminder that learning
              is never linear. Sometimes, you have to take a step back to move
              forward. If you're considering dual booting, my advice is to
              research thoroughly, prepare for the worst, and always have a
              backup. It’s scary, but the rewards are well worth it.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              This is just the beginning of my Linux journey, but I’m already
              seeing how it’s shaping my understanding of the tech world. If
              you’ve been hesitant about learning Linux, I’d say go for
              it—you’ll gain insights that go far beyond just another operating
              system.

            <p>
              Week one of the bootcamp has been an eye-opening introduction to
              what working in tech really feels like. To mirror real-life work
              environments, we’ve been doing <strong>daily standups</strong> and
              <strong>retrospectives</strong>. These short, structured meetings
              helped us build accountability, reflect on progress, and adapt
              quickly— very much in line with the
              <strong>Agile process</strong> we’ll be using for our upcoming
              projects.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Collaboration was a huge theme this week. I was introduced to
              multiple ways of working together: using
              <strong>Live Share in VS Code</strong> for real-time coding,
              practicing <strong>driver and navigator</strong> roles for pair
              programming, and relying on
              <strong>Slack for calls</strong> alongside
              <strong>Google Meet for group meetings</strong>. Each tool had its
              own strengths, and together they created a smooth workflow that
              kept everyone aligned.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Another highlight was learning about
              <strong>success logs</strong>. This simple practice of recording
              achievements, no matter how small, really boosted motivation and
              gave me a better perspective on my own progress throughout the
              week.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>Technical Progress</strong></p>
            <p>
              On the technical side, one of my biggest wins was mastering the
              fundamentals of <strong>semantic HTML tags</strong>. Instead of
              just throwing everything into &lt;div&gt; elements, I now
              understand the importance of using elements like &lt;header&gt;,
              &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;. This not
              only improves accessibility but also makes my code cleaner and
              easier to maintain.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Looking back, this first week has already given me a strong
              foundation in teamwork, communication, and technical skills. If
              this is just the beginning, I’m excited to see what the rest of
              the bootcamp will bring.

            <p>
              This week was all about <strong>CSS</strong>, and it kicked off
              with a refresher exercise where we followed a tutorial to
              understand how to approach styling problems. It wasn’t just about
              writing code—it was about seeing the workflow, the thought
              process, and how to break down a design into manageable steps.
            </p>

            <p>
              We also had two fantastic masterclasses. The first, led by
              <strong>Pete</strong>, was focused on
              <strong>web tools and essential VS Code extensions</strong>. It
              opened my eyes to just how much efficiency and organization you
              can gain with the right setup. The second masterclass, run by
              <strong>David</strong>, was all about
              <strong>careers advice</strong>. He walked us through the
              recruitment process and gave practical insights on how to stand
              out to employers. It was encouraging to hear strategies straight
              from someone who understands what recruiters look for.
            </p>

            <p>
              The highlight for me, though, was working with
              <strong>Matt</strong> on a joint HTML and CSS challenge. We
              attempted to apply the <strong>BEM methodology</strong>,
              experiment with <strong>animations and transitions</strong>, and
              incorporate <strong>CSS variables</strong>. Personally, I really
              enjoyed working with variables—they made the code so much cleaner
              and flexible. On the other hand, I learned that
              <strong>Tailwind isn’t really my style</strong>; while it has its
              strengths, I prefer having more direct control over my CSS.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looking back, Week 2 gave me both technical growth and
              professional insights. I’m starting to see how the bootcamp
              balances coding skills with career preparation, and I’m excited to
              carry these lessons forward into the next stage.

              Week 3 introduced us to the world of <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
              and our first challenge was to build a small project using an
              <strong>API</strong>. The task was simple but powerful: take user
              input from a search bar, press a button, and return data
              dynamically. For my project, I chose a
              <strong>Football API</strong> that allows users to search for
              their favourite team and instantly see a list of all players
              currently in the squad. It was both fun and rewarding to see data
              pulled in from an external source and displayed on my page.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the same day, we had a
              <strong>masterclass with Pete</strong> where he gave us valuable
              insights into making the most of <strong>GitHub</strong> (working
              with pull requests and issues) and using
              <strong>Trello</strong> to stay organised. It was a great reminder
              that good tools and workflows are just as important as writing
              good code.
            </p>

            <p>
              Day 2 was dedicated to something a little
              different—<strong>research</strong>. We were given the entire day
              to dive into a topic of interest, then prepare and deliver a
              presentation. This exercise pushed me to think critically, gather
              information efficiently, and present it clearly. A big thanks to
              <strong>Naomi</strong> for her guidance and support throughout the
              day—it made a real difference.
            </p>

            <p>
              We rounded off the week with another brilliant
              <strong>careers talk by David</strong>. This time, the focus was
              on maximising our <strong>LinkedIn profiles</strong> to stand out
              to recruiters. The advice was practical and immediately
              actionable, giving me plenty of ideas to improve my own profile
              and online presence.

            <p>
              Overall, this week struck a perfect balance: learning technical
              skills, improving research and presentation abilities, and
              continuing to grow in terms of career preparation. Each week feels
              like a new step forward, and I’m already excited for what’s next.

              Week 4 of the
              <strong>TechNative Software Development Bootcamp</strong> was all
              about <strong>collaboration and workflow</strong>. Our challenge
              was to create a fully functional company website as a team,
              applying real-world development practices throughout the process.
              I worked with <strong>Louise</strong> and
              <strong>Yorick</strong> to build <strong>HappyToes</strong> — an
              e-commerce website for a fictional sock company 🧦, using
              <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              What made this week stand out wasn’t just the coding, but how we
              worked together. We used <strong>GitHub Projects</strong> to
              organise our tasks through a <strong>Kanban board</strong>,
              created <strong>branches and pull requests</strong> for every
              feature, and reviewed each other’s work before merging.
              Communication was key — thanks to
              <strong>constant updates on Slack</strong>, we managed to avoid
              merge conflicts entirely and kept our workflow clean and
              efficient.
            </p>

            <p>
              This hands-on experience gave me a deeper understanding of how
              professional software teams collaborate — from planning and
              reviewing to problem-solving and delivery. Working closely with
              Louise and Yorick showed just how much smoother a project runs
              when communication and version control are done right.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the end of the week, seeing <strong>HappyToes</strong> come to
              life felt incredibly rewarding. It wasn’t just about building a
              website; it was about building trust, communication, and good
              development habits. Each week, the bootcamp continues to mirror
              real workplace scenarios, helping us grow not just as developers,
              but as effective teammates too.

              ✅ <strong>Week 5 complete</strong> at the
              <strong>TechNative Digital Software Development Bootcamp!</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              We kicked off the week with our
              <strong>Week 4 presentations</strong>, which went really well. It
              was inspiring to see how other teams approached their projects and
              the different ways people solved similar challenges. It gave me
              new perspectives on how to structure projects and communicate
              design decisions more effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
              This week, I’ve teamed up with <strong>Tymur Soroka</strong> and
              <strong>Ravind Gowda</strong> for a brand new challenge focused on
              working with <strong>APIs</strong>. We’re implementing two — one
              using <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to generate text dynamically based
              on user prompts, and another to display products fetched from
              <strong>Django</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              So far, we’ve set up our <strong>GitHub Project board</strong> to
              manage tasks, created and merged several
              <strong>pull requests</strong>, and started integrating both APIs
              into an existing project. It’s been a great way to experience a
              real-world development workflow — from collaboration and version
              control to code reviews and debugging together.
            </p>

            <p>
              Working with Tymur and Ravind has been a really positive
              experience. We’ve all contributed ideas, communicated actively,
              and maintained a clean, conflict-free workflow. It’s also given me
              a chance to deepen my understanding of
              <strong>JavaScript</strong> and API integration in a practical
              setting.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m looking forward to presenting our progress next week and
              seeing how far we can take this project! 🚀
            </p>
